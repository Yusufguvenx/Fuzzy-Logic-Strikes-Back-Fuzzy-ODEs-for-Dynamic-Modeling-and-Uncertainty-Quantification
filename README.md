# Fuzzy Logic Strikes Back: Fuzzy ODEs for Dynamic Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification

Matlab implementation of the following paper:

```
Y. Guven, T. Kumbasar, 2025. Fuzzy Logic Strikes Back: Fuzzy ODEs for Dynamic Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification, IEEE TAI.
```
We kindly ask that to cite the above mentioned paper if you use FLSs functions and you publish papers about work that was performed using these codes.

Before utilizing the code, ensure that the corresponding "lib" files for All FLSs are added to your MATLAB path. Additionally, please ensure that you correctly adjust the paths for the datasets according to your directory structure.

This repository will be updated to include any new methods published in the future.
